KAJ – Live Music Photography
KAJ, the Finnish-Swedish speaking Eurovision band, delivered an electrifying performance as part of Slush 2025. As part of a talented photography team, we captured the raw energy and unique moments of the live show from both top and bottom stage positions, documenting the band's dynamic presence and connection with the audience in real time.
