Mutate Renace – Brand Revival & Lifestyle Identity
Mutate is more than a clothing store—it's a curated lifestyle concept born from a nomadic vision and global sensibility. Founder Gonzalo's passion for mid-century modernism and Nordic design drives an intentional collection that prioritizes aesthetics, quality, and sustainable consumption over fleeting trends.
When fire devastated the original space, we saw an opportunity for transformation. Working alongside Gonzalo, we developed Mutate Renace—a reborn identity that honors the store's core values while embracing renewal and resilience. The single Buddha statue that survived the fire became a symbolic anchor, representing continuity through change.
Our comprehensive rebrand encompassed a refined visual identity, atmospheric photography showcasing each piece's narrative, a thoughtfully designed catalog, and a digital presence that captures the nomadic spirit. Strategic campaign materials for events across José Ignacio's creative community reinforced Mutate's positioning as a destination for those who value substance over trends—a space where timeless design and conscious consumption intersect.
The result is a brand that celebrates heritage, craftsmanship, and the stories embedded in every carefully selected garment.
