Ravintola Alora
Alora is a kebab restaurant that showcases high-quality kebab, fully handmade. It combines local meat providers with Italian flour for their pizzas to bring the image of kebab to another level.
Throughout the project, we created a script and aesthetics that align with the branding strategy designed to pursue their strategic goals. The result is unique, high-end visuals of their restaurant.
