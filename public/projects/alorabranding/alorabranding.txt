Ravintola Alora – Brand Identity & Campaign
Alora represents a shift in fast-food culture: a family-owned kebab and pizza restaurant that honors old-world traditions while embracing contemporary appeal. We developed a comprehensive rebranding strategy that repositions Alora as a premium, handcrafted alternative in the fast-food market.
The visual identity centers on striking monochromatic photography that captures the craft and authenticity behind every dish. Our campaign taglines—"Real Handmade Kebab," "Real Handmade Pizza," and the provocative "Real Fast Food"—challenge industry conventions by celebrating quality over speed. The strategic use of the secondary color (#93181A) emphasizes key messaging while maintaining a sophisticated, minimalist aesthetic.
Behind-the-scenes content showcases the artistry and dedication of the team, reinforcing the brand's core values of tradition, craftsmanship, and family heritage. Through carefully curated visuals and bilingual messaging (Finnish and English), we created a cohesive brand experience that speaks to both local pride and modern sensibilities.
